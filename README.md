Unit Converter using python 
A unit converter in Python is a program that allows you to convert one unit of measurement to another. It's a useful tool for converting values like length, weight, temperature, and more from one unit to another. Here's a general outline of how you can create a simple unit converter in Python:

* Choose the units to convert: Decide which units of measurement you want to convert between. For example, you might want to convert from meters to feet, kilograms to pounds, or Celsius to Fahrenheit.

* Gather conversion factors: You'll need conversion factors to perform the conversions accurately. These factors define the relationship between the two units. You can find these factors online or calculate them if needed.

* Take user input: Prompt the user to input the value they want to convert and the units they are converting from and to.

* Perform the conversion: Use the conversion factors to calculate the converted value.

* Display the result: Print the converted value to the user.
